## P02 - Vector Class 2
### Bryce Koch
### Description:

My program uses the vector class created in program 1 to implement the use of overloaded operators. My program allows
a user to more easily print out to the console and an output file, add, subtract, and multiply two vectors together,
set two vectors equal to each other, and test the equality of two vectors. Using the standard operator for each operation,
the user can perform all of the listed operations without the need of a function call.

### Instructions

- Requires iostream and fstream to work.

- Example Command:
    - cout << v4:  Prints out vector v4.
    - v1 = v2 * v3: Stores the result of v2 time v3 in v1.
    - cout << v3 == v2: tests equality between v3 and v2.
